      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>
        Peter Parker, a shy and intelligent teenager from Queens, New York, was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben after the death of his parents. His life changed dramatically when he was bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him superhuman abilities.

      <h2>Powers</h2>
      <p>
        These powers include enhanced strength, speed, agility, reflexes, and durability; the ability to cling to solid surfaces; and a precognitive "spider-sense" that alerts him to danger. Utilizing his scientific acumen, Peter designed wrist-mounted web-shooters that allow him to swing between buildings and immobilize foes.

      <h2>Morality</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, Peter used his newfound abilities for personal gain. However, after his Uncle Ben was tragically killed by a criminal Peter had previously ignored, he embraced the ethos that "with great power comes great responsibility," dedicating his life to fighting crime as Spider-Man.
